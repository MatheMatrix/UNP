### Neutron L3(VPN) Agent

#### 启动进程
```
/usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/neutron-vpn-agent \
--config-file /usr/share/neutron/neutron-dist.conf \
--config-dir /usr/share/neutron/l3_agent \
--config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
--config-dir /etc/neutron/conf.d/common \
--config-dir /etc/neutron/conf.d/neutron-vpn-agent \
--log-file /var/log/neutron/vpn-agent.log
```
`说明：本版本中的 L3 Agent 和 VPN Agent 共用一个进程，即：neutron-vpn-agent。
需要特别注意的是，L3 Agent 和 VPN Agent 一定不能同时启动，当在集群中遇到关于
L3 的问题时，可以首先检查上述两个进程是否同时启动了。`

#### 需要注意的参数

1. `agent_mode`。该参数指定本 L3 Agent 的工作模式：
   - `legacy`: this preserves the existing behavior where the L3 agent is
     deployed on a centralized networking node to provide L3 services
     like DNAT, and SNAT. Use this mode if you do not want to adopt DVR.
   - `dvr`: this mode enables DVR functionality, and must be used for an L3
     agent that runs on a compute host.
   - `dvr_snat`: this enables centralized SNAT support in conjunction with
     DVR. This mode must be used for an L3 agent running on a centralized
     node (or in single-host deployments, e.g. devstack).

2. 当配置多个外部网络时，`gateway_external_network_id` 和 `external_network_bridge`
   都需要配置成空。
